# Coding Interview Preparation Repository

Welcome to the Coding Interview Preparation repository! This repository is designed for anyone interested in preparing for coding interviews. It focuses on fundamental algorithms and problem-solving techniques that are essential for coding interviews. I, **ekgns33**, am the organizer of this repository, and the content is open for contributions from anyone who wants to join the preparation journey.

The primary resources for this preparation include **Grokking the Coding Interview**, **System Design**, **Blind75 Leetcode**, and **NeetCode**.

## üìö Key Resources

- **Grokking the Coding Interview**: A structured course that teaches core problem-solving patterns for common coding interview questions.
- **System Design**: Covers basic system design concepts, such as high-level architecture, load balancing, and distributed systems, with interview-style problem-solving.
- **Blind75 Leetcode**: A set of 75 fundamental problems that are commonly asked in coding interviews. This will help build a strong foundation in key topics.
- **NeetCode**: A guide that covers essential algorithms and data structures in a systematic manner to prepare for coding interviews.

## üìù Curriculum

1. **Core Data Structures & Algorithms**
   - Focus on essential data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, backtracking).
   - Emphasize basic, yet critical, problem-solving techniques to tackle common coding interview questions.

2. **Grokking the Coding Interview**
   - Learn key problem-solving patterns such as Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Fast & Slow Pointers, and others that are crucial for interviews.
   - Solve problems using these patterns to develop a deeper understanding of how to approach typical coding challenges.

3. **Leetcode Blind75**
   - Solve 75 carefully selected problems that cover a range of topics frequently encountered in coding interviews.
   - Focus on efficiency and optimization, ensuring solutions are both correct and performant.

4. **System Design**
   - Understand core system design concepts, including basic architecture, scalability, and high-level system design problems commonly asked in interviews.
   - Solve practical system design problems and discuss solutions with a focus on clarity and communication.

5. **NeetCode**
   - Focus on essential algorithms and data structures from the NeetCode curriculum to strengthen core problem-solving skills.
   - Apply these algorithms to solve Leetcode problems and other interview-style challenges.

## üîÑ Approach

- **Daily Practice**: Solve at least one problem per day to stay consistent and keep improving problem-solving skills.
- **Weekly Reviews**: Review progress weekly to identify weak points and revisit problems that need further attention.
- **System Design Drills**: Regularly practice system design interviews and problem-solving sessions to improve your ability to explain solutions clearly and confidently.
- **Collaborative Learning**: This repository is open to everyone. Feel free to contribute by sharing solutions, insights, or resources that can help others.

## üéØ Goal

- Become Superdupa Brilliant Software Engineer! Haha
